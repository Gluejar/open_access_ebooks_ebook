This is the source archive for the ebook "Open Access eBooks" by E. S. Hellman.

My hope is that we can figure out ways to take advantage of the openness of Creative Commons licensed books in some new ways.

To build the epub file from the source folder, I used the instructions from here:
https://sites.google.com/site/spontaneousderivation/an-epub-tutorial/creating-the-epub-file

(actually I used an applescript from danrodney based on these instructions

I followed "best practice recommendations" from http://blog.threepress.org/2009/11/20/best-practices-in-epub-cover-images/

I used the css from https://github.com/mattharrison/epub-css-starter-kit

I then beat at it till it passed epubcheck 3.0: http://validator.idpf.org/
